            <h3>Final <span>Round </span> </h3>
            <p>
                1. Two teams will compete against each other like in the qualifier one.
               
            
                </p>
              <br>
            <p>  2. Each round will have duration of 2 minutes. The team which wins two rounds first (each
                of 2 min) will be declared the winner of the match.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 3. The team that pushes the opposition robot out of the arena (i.e. out of the red zone) is
                declared as the winner of that round.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 4. The scoring pattern will be uniform throughout and the scores will be considered only in
                case of a tie i.e. if no team is able to push the opponent’s robot out of the arena in that
                round.</p>
            <br>
            <p>  5. In case of a tie in a round (i.e. none of the team’s robot is able to push the opposition
                robot out of the arena), the winner will be decided by the points earned by each team in
                that round.</p>
            <br>
            <p> 6. In case of a tie in the match, the winner of the match will be decided by a tie breaker.</p>

            <!-- <p>String is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string. For example:
                <br>char[] ch={'P','r','e','P','2','4','2','5'};  
                <br>String s=new String(ch); 
                <br>is same as:
                <br>String s="Prep24-25";   </p>
            <p>String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.</p>
                <p>The Java String is immutable which means it cannot be changed. Whenever we change any string, a new instance is created. For mutable strings, you can use StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes.</p> -->
